## **Why I Did It**
Horiseon, a marketing agency, needed to ensure that their codebase for their website met accessibility standards. The agency provided me with their workiing codebase requesting minor modifications, improved formatting, and a clean up (consolidation) of the index.html and style.css files. Once complete, the website would be optimized for search engines as well as Horiseon's customers.

## **What I Started With**
I began with an index.html and style.css file both containing code that made up all of the visual aspects and information seen on Horiseon's homepage. I was also given a mock-up of what the finished site should look like. 

To begin, I determined the areas that were in need of improvment in both files:

<table><tr><td>

  > **HTML**
  + Formatting
  + Structure
  + < `title` >
  + Link functions
  + Over usage of < `div` >
  + Accessible image elements

</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td>

  > **CSS**
  + Order of the rules
  + Multiple classes containing <br/> duplicate declarations
  + Class names

</td></tr></table>
