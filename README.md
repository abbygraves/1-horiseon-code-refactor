## **Why I Did It**
Horiseon, a marketing agency, needed to ensure that their codebase for their website met accessibility standards. The agency provided me with their workiing codebase requesting minor modifications, improved formatting, and a clean up (consolidation) of the index.html and style.css files. Once complete, the website would be optimized for search engines as well as Horiseon's customers.

<br/>

## **What I Started With**
I began with an index.html and style.css file both containing code that made up all of the visual aspects and information seen on Horiseon's homepage. I was also given a mock-up of what the finished site should look like. 

```md

```

To begin, I determined the areas that were in need of improvment in both files:

### <ins>HTML</ins>
+ Formatting
+ Structure
+ `title` element
+ Link functions
+ Over usage of `div` element
+ Accessible image elements

<br/>

### <ins>CSS</ins>
+ Order of the rules
+ Multiple classes containing <br/> duplicate declarations
+ Class names
